# Fact-Check Expert

Systematically verify factual claims in an expert persona's files, remove unverifiable information, and generate a comprehensive references document with sources.

- Request to "add references" or "cite sources" for an expert
- Reviewing expert files for accuracy
- Preparing expert for publication or sharing
- Quality assurance on persona content

|-------|----------|-------------|
| expert_name | Yes | The expert folder name (e.g., "miles-davis", "steve-jobs") |
| thoroughness | No | "quick" (biographical only), "standard" (all categories), "exhaustive" (cross-reference 3+ sources) |

```
CLAIM EXTRACTION LOG
====================
File: expertise.md

BIOGRAPHICAL:
- [L12] "Born: May 26, 1926, Alton, Illinois"
- [L13] "Died: September 28, 1991, Santa Monica, California"

```

### Step 2: Verify Each Claim

For each extracted claim:

2. **Cross-reference** with 2+ sources when possible
3. **Record** source URLs and verification status
4. **Flag** any discrepancies or conflicting information

Verification statuses:
- ✓ **Verified** - Confirmed by reliable source(s)
- ⚠ **Corrected** - Original claim had error; corrected with source
- ✗ **Unverifiable** - No reliable source found; will be removed
- ? **Uncertain** - Conflicting sources; needs human review

### Step 3: Generate references.md

Create a comprehensive references document in the expert folder:

```markdown
# {Expert Name} - References & Fact Verification

**Verification Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Expert Folder:** `experts/{expert-name}/`
**Thoroughness Level:** {quick|standard|exhaustive}

```

---

## Quality Standards

### Acceptable Sources (in order of preference)

1. **Primary sources** - Original works, speeches, interviews by the person
2. **Academic sources** - Peer-reviewed articles, university press books
3. **Encyclopedia sources** - Britannica, specialized encyclopedias
4. **Wikipedia** - For basic biographical facts (with citation to Wikipedia's sources)
5. **Reputable news** - Major newspapers, established magazines
6. **Industry databases** - AllMusic, IMDb, USPTO, etc.

### Unacceptable Sources

- Personal blogs without citations
- Social media posts
- User-generated content without verification
- Sources with clear bias or conflict of interest
- Circular citations (A cites B which cites A)

---

## Notes

- Focus verification effort on claims that matter most to the persona's authenticity
- Quotes require the highest verification standard (exact wording matters)
- Dates within ±1 year are acceptable for non-critical events
- When sources conflict, prefer primary sources or more authoritative secondary sources
- If a claim cannot be verified but is non-essential, remove it rather than include uncertainty

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
- input_data: [Specific example input]
- context: [Relevant background]

**Output:**

[Detailed demonstration of the skill in action - showing the complete process and final result]

**Why this works:**
This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill by [explanation of what makes it effective].
